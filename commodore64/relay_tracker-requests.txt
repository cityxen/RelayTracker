Feature requests for Relay Tracker:

- Paddle/potentiometer for speed and position

- Joystick control mode for:
    - home
    - up
    - down
    - step

- Commands:
    - pulse/flash for a step with rate as ratio of speed
    - fraction of a step, eg 25%/50%/75%/100%
    - jump to step

- At higher speeds a bit more spread for more gradual setting

- A way to set pattern length easily

- Fill options?
    - fill channel 1 with a on event every 3rd step
    - fill random, etc.

- Presets?
    - “cylon”
    - “bounce”
    - “zigzag”
    - “rain”
    - etc

- Option to have pins active high or active low, can be done already by selecting vic rel, but only 6 are shown,
    it would be good to have all 8 as a option to set high or low,
    this would allow for example transistor or logic pcbs to be used as well. 

- A shuffle setting, where every other pulse can be pushed forward or back in time
    slightly for a swing feel (can look cool with lights too)
