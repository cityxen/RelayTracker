# Relay Tracker

This program allows you to program and playback a sequence of states for an 8 Channel relay board similar to a VIC-Rel for the Commodore 64. It may even work with a VIC-Rel, but can't test it. If someone has a VIC-Rel and would like to test it, please let us know if it works. The schematic for each device will be in the folder for that machine.

Here is a brief demo of what this looks like in operation during the early stages of development: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtZTxJKP-fk
